- **Bug Fix** (Multisite): Fixed a Multisite uninstallation bug that was preventing Comment Mail from taking Child Blogs into consideration when uninstalling, which was resulting in an incomplete uninstallation. See [Issue #136](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/136).
- **Bug Fix** (StCR Import): This release corrects an StCR importation bug. The bug was causing an existing StCR subscription with a `Y` status (i.e., one for all comments/replies) to be imported into Comment Mail on a per-comment basis. Therefore, a symptom of this bug was to find that you had multiple subscriptions imported for users who wanted _all_ comments, instead of them just having one subscription imported which would automatically cover the entire post. See also [Issue #162](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/162).
- **Bug Fix** (StCR Import): Fixed a bug with the StCR Import routine that was preventing subscriptions for comments awaiting approval from being imported. See [Issue #182](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/182).
- **Bug Fix** (StCR Import): Fixed a bug in how the Subscribe to Comments Reloaded Import routine counts imported subscriptions. Comment Mail was previously reporting the number of subscriptions that it created during the import as the total number imported, however due to a difference in how Comment Mail and StCR store subscriptions, the total number of StCR subscriptions imported is almost always going to be different from the number of subscriptions that Comment Mail creates. This difference resulted in confusion about why the total StCR subscriptions did not match the total reported by Comment Mail as "imported". This has been fixed by adjusting what is reported as 'total imported' and including two new pieces of information: 'total skipped' and 'total created'. When you add the 'total imported' and 'total skipped' numbers together, that number should equal the number of subscriptions reported in StCR. Props @Reedyseth @jaswsinc. See [Issue #166](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/166).
- **Bug Fix**: Removed a UTF-8 "Branch Icon" in the default email templates that was not showing up properly in some email clients. Props @renzms @kristineds. See [Issue #116](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/116).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an email template bug that was forcing an ellipsis to show even when the length of the comment content was shorter than the max length. See [this commit](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/commit/80aab562fb1fe3cdcdb4f10eda7e74c8ea21aa61) for details.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an email template bug that was not linking the "add reply" link directly to the comment form for replying to the comment (it was just linking to the comment itself). See [this commit](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/commit/686b2737e708dc4a70ede129b7f4a9151c150907#commitcomment-14925636) for details.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a bug with "Restore Default Options" that was introducing a browser quirk that was preventing the default options from being restored. Props @renzms. See [Issue #181](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/181).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a bug where certain icons would not appear, or the wrong icon would appear, when Comment Mail was installed alongside the ZenCache plugin. Both plugins use the same Sharkicons library, but were using different versions, which introduced a conflict. Comment Mail has been updated to use the latest version of the Sharkicons library. Props @Reedyseth. See [Issue #87](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/87#issuecomment-166458711).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a UI bug where some of the Dashboard notices generated by Comment Mail were either misaligned or were clashing with the Subscribe to Comments Reloaded options menu. Props @renzms. See [Issue #186](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/186).
- **Enhancement (Pro)**: Added a "Pro" label to the plugin name to clearly indicate when the Pro version of Comment Mail is installed. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #131](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/131).
- **Enhancement (Pro)**: Added a note to the default email templates when RVE (Replies via Email) is enabled, warning email readers that "Your reply will be posted publicly and immediately." Props @Reedyseth. See [Issue #123](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/123).
- **Enhancement (Pro):** If you have Comment Mail's SSO integration enabled and have users who are registering an account via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google+, the SSO service that a particular user (or commenter) signed up with is now shown in the list of Users. Props @kristineds See [Issue #73](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/73).
- **Enhancement (Pro):** Theme Syntax Highlighting: This release makes it possible for the color-scheme used in template file syntax highlighting to be changed to any one of 30+ options. See: _Dashboard → Comment Mail → Config. Options → Template-Related Settings_. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #147](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/147).
- **Enhancement** (StCR Import): Moved the Import Status box (for importing Subscribe to Comments Reloaded subscriptions) up underneath the "Begin StCR Auto-Importation" button to improve visibility when importing subscriptions. See [Issue #172](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/172).
- **Enhancement** (StCR Import): The "Upgrading from Subscribe to Comments Reloaded" notice, which appears when installing Comment Mail on a site running the StCR plugin, is now automatically hidden once you run the StCR import process. See [Issue #169](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/169).
- **Enhancement** (StCR Import): During the import process, Comment Mail now keeps track of and reports total number of StCR subscriptions skipped and total number of Comment Mail subscriptions created. Skipped subscriptions are the number of StCR subscriptions that were not imported for one of several possible reasons. See [Issue #166](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/166).
- **Enhancement** (StCR Import): The StCR importer now generates a log file in `comment-mail-pro/stcr-import-failures.log` that includes reports of any failures or skipped subscriptions, along with information about why they failed or why they were skipped. Note that this file is only created if there were failures or skipped subscriptions during import. See [Issue #166](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/166).
- **Enhancement**: Removed references to "CAN-SPAM Act", which is a United States law that may not be understood or applicable to Comment Mail users outside of the United States. Props @Li-An and @kristineds. See [Issue #122](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/122).
- **Enhancement**: Added the default translation file. Translators can now build translations using the default translation file located in `includes/translations/`. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #118](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/118).
- **Enhancement**: Improved the on-hover color when hovering the mouse over Option Panels in the Comment Mail Options by changing it from green to dark blue. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #117](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/117).
- **Enhancement**: Improved the Subscriptions table and the Event Log UI by using proper case for Status and Event values. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #72](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/72).
- **Enhancement**: Comment Mail is now only enabled for the standard `post` Post Type by default and there's a new "Enable for Post Types" option inside _Comment Mail → Config. Options → Enable/Disable_ that allows you to specify a comma-delimited list of Post Types that Comment Mail should be enabled for. It's also possible to enable Comment Mail on all Post Types that support comments by leaving the field empty (this was the previous behavior). Props to @bonest. See [Issue #149](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/149).
- **Enhancement**: Improved Dashboard notices. The "Upgrading from Subscribe to Comments Reloaded" message has been improved and a new Dashboard notice lets you know when Comment Mail is disabled. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #163](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/163).
- **Enhancement**: Many improvements the default email templates. The templates are now fully responsive and look much better on mobile devices. The wording in several places was also cleaned up for clarity and consistency and any references to an ID# (which is generally useless for readers) have been removed. The default templates also use a single font style now instead of mixing font styles and the email templates no longer use tables (this improves responsiveness). If you've modified the default Comment Mail email templates on your site, your changes will not be overwritten by updating, however if you've modified the templates and you want to get these changes, you'll need to reset to the default email templates and make your changes again (you can do this by emptying the email template fields completely and saving your options). See [Issue #77](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/77).
- **Enhancement**: Ellipses (`...`) in email templates are now surrounded by square brackets (i.e., `[...]`) to avoid confusion about whether or not the ellipsis was part of the comment content. See [Issue #77](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/77).
- **Enhancement**: In the email templates, the "Add Reply" links have been changed to "Reply" and when the reply is in response to someone and we have the authors name, the link includes the authors name (e.g., "Reply to <author-name>"). See [Issue #77](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/77).
- **Enhancement**: Updated email templates to use `\WP_Comment` instead of `\stdClass` where appropriate. See [Issue #77](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/77).
- **Enhancement**: The manual "Add New Subscription" functionality has been hidden from the front-end of the site (i.e., hidden from the "My Comment Subscriptions" page that subscribers use to manage their subscriptions, and from email templates). Note that this change has no effect on the subscription options that appear on the comment form itself. See discussion in [Issue #108](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/108#issuecomment-161462209).
- **WordPress v4.4 Compatibility:** Fixed a compatibility bug with WordPress v4.4. Props @jaswsinc. See [Issue #170](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/170).
- **Jetpack Compatibility:** This release fixes a bug in the automatic Jetpack conflict detection; i.e., if you enable Jetpack Subscriptions w/ Follow Comments enabled together with Comment Mail at the same, a warning is displayed to notify you of a possible conflict in your configuration. See [Issue #113](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/113).
