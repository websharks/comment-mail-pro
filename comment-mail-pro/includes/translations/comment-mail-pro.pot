If a reply does not include a quoted section when replying to an email notification, an <code>%2$s</code> marker can be used instead. When %1$s reads <code>%2$s</code>, it will use it as a marker and ignore everything below that line. Everything above <code>%2$s</code> will become the comment reply on your blog. Therefore, you can use the <code>%2$s</code> feature even if you have quoting turned off in your email client. If neither of these are found, the reply is still accepted.

This setting allows you to control the max number of email notifications that it should work on in each process. In short, you can use this option to control the maximum number of emails that can ever be sent by each queue runner. Keep in mind, the Queue Processor runs once every 5 minutes. The limit that you define here will allow X number of emails to be sent each time that it runs. The minimum allowed value is <code>1</code>.
